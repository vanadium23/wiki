> Dashboards > newspapers. If you are in tech, the first thing you look at each day may be a personal or company dashboard, like your fitbit or your sales. This is good. The first thing you look at each day shouldnâ€™t be random stories someone else picked. Should be carefully selected metrics you want to improve. This is a good vector of attack to definitionally disrupt newspapers.
