> Note that in this example the Protestants, and then the Lutherans, and then the Baptists had to attract people to their interpretations. Many other competing denominations did not. This process of constantly forking and innovating and having it compete in the marketplace brings in new blood. And that’s the concept of the recentralized center. The way to demonstrate it’s a step forward is via mass exodus of people from both American Anarchy and Chinese Control to the recentralized center, to high-trust startup societies and network states.
