How do you find the zeros in your system? Zeros don’t hide. In fact, they are usually quite obvious when you draw your perspective back, allowing you to see your system as a whole. They are usually what we deliberately ignore, naively hoping that they will “fix themselves” or that someone might come along who can magic a solution. Zeros are persistent, structural flaws that intimidate us. If we avoid them, this is when we fall prey to snake oil salesmen who promise they have an easy (and often expensive) solution based on the latest technology/psychology/accidental success of someone else.
