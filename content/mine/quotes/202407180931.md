> Static coupling refers to the way architectural parts (classes, components, services, and so on) are wired together: dependencies, coupling degree, connection points, and so on. An architect can often measure static coupling at compile time as it represents the static dependencies within the architecture. Dynamic coupling refers to how architecture parts call one another: what kind of communication, what information is passed, strictness of contracts, and so on.
