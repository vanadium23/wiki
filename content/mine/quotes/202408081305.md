> Because services are built from components, it is critical to not only identify the components within an application, but to properly size them as well. This pattern is used to identify components that are either too big (doing too much) or too small (not doing enough). Components that are too large relative to other components are generally more coupled to other components, are harder to break into separate services, and lead to a less modular architecture.
