> Granularity disintegrators provide guidance and justification for when to break a service into smaller pieces. While the justification for breaking up a service may involve only a single driver, in most cases the justification will be based on multiple drivers. The six main drivers for granularity disintegration are as follows: 
> - Service scope and function 
>     - Is the service doing too many unrelated things? 
> - Code volatility 
>     - Are changes isolated to only one part of the service? 
> - Scalability and throughput 
>     - Do parts of the service need to scale differently? 
> - Fault tolerance 
>     - Are there errors that cause critical functions to fail within the service? 
> - Security 
>     - Do some parts of the service need higher security levels than others? 
> - Extensibility 
>     - Is the service always expanding to add new contexts?
