> The four main drivers for granularity integration are as follows: 
> - **Database transactions:** Is an ACID transaction required between separate services? 
> - **Workflow and choreography:** Do services need to talk to one another? 
> - **Shared code:** Do services need to share code among one another? 
> - **Database relationships:** Although a service can be broken apart, can the data it uses be broken apart as well?
