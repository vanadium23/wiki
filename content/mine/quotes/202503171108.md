> When your results consistently take a nosedive and your past successes seem distant memories, diminishing returns have likely set in. We cannot expect that if we keep doing things the same way, we will always get the same remarkable results. This model reminds us that change is an essential element of moving forward. Even if it’s not broken, there is always something to fix. Don’t let early success make you complacent. Plan for diminishing returns, and you just might avoid them.
