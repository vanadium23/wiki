> Rapid skill acquisition has four major steps:
> 1. Deconstructing a skill into the smallest possible subskills;
> 2. Learning enough about each subskill to be able to practice intelligently and self-correct during practice;
> 3. Removing physical, mental, and emotional barriers that get in the way of practice;
> 4. Practicing the most important subskills for at least twenty hours.
