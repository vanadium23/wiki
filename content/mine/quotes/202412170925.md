> Frequently within highly distributed architectures like microservices and serverless environments, phrases like “reuse is abuse!” and “share nothing!” are touted by architects in an attempt to reduce the amount of shared code within these types of architectures. Architects in these environments have even been found to offer countering advice to the famous DRY principle (Don’t repeat yourself) by using an opposing acronym called WET (Write every time or Write everything twice).
