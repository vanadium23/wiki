> Architecture Stories Throughout this chapter, we will be using architecture stories as a way of recording and describing code refactoring that impacts the structural aspect of the application for each of the Sysops Squad sagas. Unlike user stories, which describe a feature that needs to be implemented or changed, an architecture story describes particular code refactoring that impacts the overall structure of an application and satisfies some sort of business driver (such as increased scalability, better time-to-market, etc.). For example, if an architect sees the need to break apart a payment service to support better overall extensibility for adding additional payment types, a new architecture story would be created and read as follows: As an architect, I need to decouple the payment service to support better extensibility and agility when adding additional payment types. We view architecture stories as separate from technical debt stories. Technical debt stories usually capture things a developer needs to do in a later iteration to “clean up the code,” whereas an architecture story captures something that needs to change quickly to support a particular architectural characteristic or business need.
