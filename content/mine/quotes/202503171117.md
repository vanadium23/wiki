> Choose a model, maybe one per week, and start looking at your life through that lens. What do you notice? What looks different? Write down or record your observations. Take the time to reflect on your experiences using each model, because it is through reflection that the most valuable knowledge builds. Note where you make a different choice based on the insight provided by the model. Pay attention to what worked and improved your outcomes. Learn from your mistakes. Over time you will build knowledge of where each model is most useful and most likely to help you.
